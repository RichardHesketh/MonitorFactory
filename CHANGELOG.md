## 1.0.00 (September 1, 2015)

  - This project was begun by The PowerShell Guy, aka MoW, several years back and then apparently abandoned
    (at http://thepowershellguy.com/blogs/posh/archive/2007/01/21/powershell-gui-scripblock-monitor-script.aspx).
    I picked it up a couple years later and decided to refurbish, refresh, and enhance it.
	And now I am ready to release it into the wild.
